# CLAUDE.md — Growth OS (GrowthHub)

## 1. PRODUCT CONTEXT

**What is this?**
An AI-powered Growth Operating System — a closed-loop decision engine for ecommerce/DTC brands.

**Core Loop:**
Data → Insight → Decision → Action → Result → Learning → Better Decision

**Critical Distinction:**
- Competitors: show insights OR run rules
- This product: thinks + decides + executes + learns

**The 3 Core Innovations:**
- Decision History = Memory System (not logs)
- Decision Center = Brain (converts signals → actions)
- Strategies = Reusable Playbooks (feeds automation)

## 3. ARCHITECTURE RULES

### Data Flow — NEVER break this
```
Frontend (Hostinger VPS) → Backend API (Railway) → Supabase (Database)
```
- Frontend NEVER calls Supabase directly
- All DB queries go through Backend API
- Backend verifies Clerk token on every request

### Database Isolation — CRITICAL
This project is subject to technical audits and investor due diligence.

- Supabase project is **fully isolated** — dedicated production project, shared with nothing
- **Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on every table** — no exceptions
- Every table has `org_id` — users only see their organization's data
- `service_role_key` lives on Backend only — never exposed to frontend
- All sensitive operations are logged in `audit_logs` table
- Data is exportable per organization for compliance

### Auth Rules — Clerk
- Every user belongs to an Organization (mandatory)
- `orgId` from Clerk = `org_id` in every DB table
- NEVER query DB without `org_id` filter
- Use `auth()` in Server Components / API routes
- Use `useAuth()` / `useOrganization()` in Client Components only
- Middleware protects all routes except `/`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`

### Deployment Flow
```
Local → GitHub → Hostinger VPS (pull + pm2 restart)
```
- Never deploy directly without pushing to GitHub first
- PM2 manages the Next.js process on the VPS
- Nginx handles SSL termination and reverse proxy

## 6. PAGE FILE RULES — CRITICAL

Every `page.tsx` = **content only**.

✅ DO:
```tsx
export default function PageName() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-8">
      {/* content here */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

❌ NEVER:
- No `<aside>` sidebar in pages
- No `<header>` topbar in pages
- No `fixed` positioning in pages
- No `h-screen` wrappers in pages

The `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` handles Sidebar + Topbar automatically.

---

## 7. STITCH HTML EXPORT CONVERSION

When given a Stitch HTML export:

1. Extract main content only — remove sidebar, topbar, nav
2. Convert colors:
   - `#005bc4` → `text-primary` / `bg-primary`
   - `#05345c` → `text-foreground`
   - `#3d618c` → `text-muted-foreground`
   - `#f8f9ff` → `bg-background`
   - `#eff4ff` → `bg-surface-container-low`
   - `#dce9ff` → `bg-surface-container-high`
   - `#ffffff` → `bg-white`
   - `border-[#91b4e4]/10` → `border-border`
3. Replace `material-symbols-outlined` → Lucide React icons
4. Static data as constants at top of file
5. Add `"use client"` only if state/interactions needed
6. `font-sans` for headings, `font-body` for body text
7. Save to correct path from routing map above

---

## 8. DESIGN TOKENS

```
primary:                #005bc4
foreground:             #05345c
muted-foreground:       #3d618c
background:             #f8f9ff
border:                 #91b4e4 (with opacity)
surface-container-low:  #eff4ff
surface-container-high: #dce9ff
```

---

## 9. DECISION HISTORY — SPECIAL NOTE

This is NOT a log table. It is the system memory and explainability layer.

Every record contains:
- `decision` — what was decided
- `action_taken` — what was executed
- `trigger_condition` — what caused it
- `data_used` — data snapshot at decision time
- `result` — success / failed / skipped
- `ai_explanation` — why the AI decided this
- `confidence_score` — 0-100

This feeds the learning loop — treat it as the most critical table in the system.

## 11. BILLING & USER PLANS

### Two User Types
| | Regular User | AppSumo LTD User |
|---|---|---|
| Billing | Subscription + Credits | One-time deal |
| API | OpenRouter (platform key) | BYOK — mandatory |
| Credits | Active | Disabled completely |

### Logic
```typescript
if (user.plan_type === 'ltd') {
  // force BYOK — credits system disabled
  // use user's own OpenRouter key from Supabase Vault
} else {
  // normal credits flow
  // deduct from org credits balance
}
```

### DB Column
```sql
-- in users or organizations table
plan_type: enum('subscription', 'ltd')
byok_openrouter_key: encrypted via Supabase Vault (nullable)
```

### Rules
- LTD users NEVER touch the platform OpenRouter key
- Credits balance check is SKIPPED for LTD users
- BYOK key is stored encrypted in Supabase Vault
- If LTD user has no BYOK key → block AI features with prompt to add key
